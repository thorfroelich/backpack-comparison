_by a 40 y.o. danish programmer with an all-season daily 20 mile bicycle commute_

#### Current pack(s) in use
* Goruck GR1, except when rainy. Then:
* Rockagator RG-25

#### Curious to try
* Hill People Gear Umlindi
* Arc'teryx Leaf Drypack 40

## Goruck GR1

### Pros
* Incredibly well crafted. Rugged and durable. Looks almost as new after a lot of use.
* Clamshell opening is convenient. Rectangular main compartment makes organising load easy. Lid has useful mesh pockets on the inside. Has a padded compartment for a laptop and inside sleeve for a tablet or similar.
* Very comfortable straps and back padding.

### Cons
* Relatively weatherproof, although zippers are a weak area. Leakage will occur in rainy conditions. Hard to properly attach a rain cover due to position of shoulder straps.
* Expensive.
* Position and low number of rows of PALS webbing limits their utility.

## Arc'teryx Arro 22

### Pros
* More weatherproof than your average weatherproof backpack.
* Excellent build quality.
* Comfortable to wear.

### Cons
* At only 22 liters it's too small for my EDC.
* Not fully waterproof. Zippers _will_ leak water during heavy rain, especially if backpack is filled to capacity putting even just a little strain on the zippers.
* External side pockets too shallow for a water bottle. Anything taller than a mug easily falls out.
* Expensive.

## Rockagator RG-25

### Pros
* Completely waterproof!

### Cons
* Heavy and unwieldy. Basically just a big polyurethane sack with shoulder straps.
* Added length due to rolltop closing combined with black interior makes it surprisingly difficult to see what's inside.
